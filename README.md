## Calendar

### Creative Portion
- Users can add a tag to their event. There are three categories: work, home study.
- Users can add a group event to their calendar. When they add a group event, they should check the "group event" box and choose the group members from the users list. When they hit the save button, this group event would show on the calendar of the users he chose as group members. On the event list, a group event would show the members of this event next to the scheduled time like this "Group members: user1,user1,user2".
- Users can share their calendars to another user by using the share function at the bottom of the calendar. Users choose the other user they want to share calendar with from the dropdown list and then hit the share button. The other user would have the access to this user's calendar when they log into their account and use the "View Shared Calendar" function. The user can see the shared calendar by choosing user name from the dropdown list.

### Feel free to test
We have created four users (user0, user1). You can log in with any of the two user names with the password 123456.
The date in the blue block is the current date.
We added two events on 10/26/2021 under the user1's account and three events under user0's account, you can check it by clicking on the date. There would be two events showing under the event list.
